# Codename: Symbiont

An evolving AI organism pet project.

## Concept

**Creating a "digital organism" (Symbiote) that**:

-   Lives in the system (microservice architecture on one VPS, locally via Docker Compose).
-   Analyzes unstructured data (text from the web, local files).
-   Builds an internal model of the "world" (knowledge graph in Neo4j, vector representations in Qdrant).
-   Interacts/expresses itself through the generation of new content (text).
-   Evolves over time based on data and, possibly, feedback.
-   Goal: The most unusual pet project with the most unusual and sophisticated stack.

## Core Tech Stack

-   **Language & Core Logic:** Rust
-   **Microservices Communication:** NATS.io
-   **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j
-   **Vector Memory:** Qdrant
-   **UI:** Rust + WASM (Yew/Dioxus)
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
